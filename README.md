# Introduction 

Our pyrit-ship-tinker is a specialized fork for the custom target cookbooks implimentation of Microsoft's PyRIT-Ship project, transformed into a Burp Suite extension for automated AI security testing by microsoft. It enables security researchers to conduct automated prompt injection testing through a custom extension-generated payload system.

This project extends PyRIT's capabilities by integrating Azure OpenAI for intelligent prompt generation and mutation, providing a streamlined workflow for testing using burpsuite.

The repository currently contains:
- /pyritship : A Python Flax Server with some basic features of PyRIT exposed over API (prompt generator and scoring)
- /burp_extension : A Java extension for BURP Suite to use PyRIT from the **Intruder** module
